# which should print "insecticide treated wheat dough" because of "super()" call in Pizza. Why is that?
# It's because inherited call to overridden method "get_dough" is determined by OrganicPizza inherited types (not by Pizza's parent as intuitively many would think), and if
# the direct parent (in this case - OrganicPizza direct parent OrganicDoughFactory) has the method of the same signature [signature = method name and parameters]
# then get_dough() will be called from direct parent
